<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
<p>
  Java isn't just a object-oriented programming (OOP) language, it is also a set of technologies that make software development faster and applications more robust and secure. <br> <br>
  Java offers following benefits:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>platform independance</li>
    <li>ease of use</li>
    <li>comprehensive libraries that speed up application development</li>
    <li>security</li>
    <li>scalability</li>
    <li>extensive industry support</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  In tradition programming, source code is compiled to executable code. This executable code can run only on the platform it is intended to run. <br>
</p>
<p>
  A Java program, on the other hand, is compiled to bytecode. You cannot run bytecode by itself, because it isn't native code. Bytecode can only be run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's a native application that interprets bytecode. <br>
  <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr> is available for many different platforms (e.g.: Windows, Unix, Linux,...), therefore code written in Java can be run on all of these without major modification.
</p>
<p>
  To run a Java programm you need:
  <ul>
    <li>A compiler (javac) which converts source code to an executable format (e.g.: bytecode).</li>
    <li>A <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr> to run bytecode.</li>
    <li>A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains JVM, Java core libraries and classes <br>
        The <abbr title="Java Runtime Environment">JRE</abbr> is different for each platform.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Object-oriented programming (OOP):</h3>
<p>
  <abbr title="object-oriented programming">OOP</abbr> works by modeling applications on real-world objects. Three principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. <br>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Benefits of OOP:</strong>
  <dl>
    <dt>1) Ease of maintenance</dt>
    <dd>You can organize very large projects easier, because interdependency is less of a struggle. The problem with large progjects is that you a change can often have a affect on other parts of the program. OOP makes applications modular and therfore less complex.</dd>
    <dt>2) Reusability</dt>
    <dd>Written code can be reused for other pars with a similiar funtionality. <br>
    OOP often come with a set of ready-to-use libraries. Java contains hundreds of carefully designed and tested class libraries or application programming interfaces (APIs). That shortens development time.</dd>
    <dt>3) Extendibility</dt>
    <dd>Every application is unique. In OOP, extendability is achieved through inheritance. You can add functionality to existing classes. You can add methods or change existing ones. This enables you to create generic classes and add funtions for each specific application.</dd>
